# Leaf Disease Classification using CNNs

This project focuses on the classification of leaf images into 38 different classes of diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN models employed for this classification task include AlexNet, VGG16, and VGG19.

## Overview

Leaf diseases in plants can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Early detection and classification of these diseases are crucial for effective disease management. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, this project aims to automate the process of identifying various leaf diseases, thus aiding in timely intervention and treatment.

## Models Used

### AlexNet

AlexNet is a deep CNN architecture consisting of eight layers, including five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. It gained prominence for its success in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012.

### VGG16 and VGG19

VGG16 and VGG19 are deep CNN architectures developed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. VGG16 comprises 16 layers, while VGG19 has 19 layers, both consisting primarily of convolutional layers stacked on top of each other.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for training and testing consists of images of diseased plant leaves belonging to 38 different classes. Each class represents a distinct type of leaf disease, including but not limited to fungal infections, bacterial infections, viral infections, and nutrient deficiencies.
